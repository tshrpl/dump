# PROJECT SYNOPSIS

### TOPIC
Potash Alum From Scrap of Aluminium

### ABOUT THE PROBLEM
One of the biggest disadvantages of recycling aluminium is its need to be separated from steel, plastic and other debris. When aluminium is continually recycled it loses its quality. So a product made with new aluminium will be of higher quality than the recycled product. The sorting is time consuming and costs money. One of the major problems on the aluminium scrap recycling is the contamination of the impurities as Fe from the steel parts mixed with the aluminium scrap.

### PRIMARY REASON TO CHOOSE THIS PROJECT
I chose this project particularly as I found the topic quite interesting and wanted to learn more about it.

### MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
The main objective of the project is to prepare an aluminium compound, Alum, from scrap of aluminium.

### Scope of the project
By recycling, scrap aluminium can be reused to make aluminium compounds like alum. This process is far less expensive and energy intensive when compared to creating new aluminium through the electrolysis of aluminium oxide, which must be mined from bauxite ore and then refined using the Bayer process. In beverage industry, the most common wastes polluting the environment are aluminium cans. Since a aluminium metal is not consumed rapidly by corrosion, the amount of scrap aluminium grows rapidly while the available supply of rawmaterials for it's manufacture decreases.

### WORKING METHODOLOGY

# INTRODUCTION

Aluminium because of its low density, high tensile strength and resistance to corrosion is widely used for the manufacture of aeroplanes, automobiles lawn furniture as well as for aluminium cans. Being good conductor of electricity it is used for transmission of electricity. Aluminium is also used for making utensils. The recycling of aluminium cans and other aluminium products is a very positive contribution to saving out natural resources. Most of the recycled aluminium is melted and recast intro other aluminium metal products or used in the production of various aluminium compounds, the most common of which are the alums. Alums are double sulphates having general formula,

**X<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>.M<sub>2</sub>(S0<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.24H<sub>2</sub>O**

**X -> Monovalent cation**

**M -> Trivalent cation**


Some important alum and their names are given below:

**K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.Al<sub>2</sub>(S0<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.24H<sub>2</sub>O - Potash Alum**

**Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.Al<sub>2</sub>(S0<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.24H<sub>2</sub>O - Soda Alum**

**K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.Cr<sub>2</sub>(S0<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.24H<sub>2</sub>O - Chrome Alum**

**(NH)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.Fe<sub>2</sub>(S0<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.24H<sub>2</sub>O - Ferric Alum**

# THEORY

Aluminium metal is treated with hot aqueous KOH solution, Aluminium dissolves as potassium aluminate, KAl(OH)<sub>4</sub> salt.

**2Al(s) + 2KOH(aq) + 6H<sub>2</sub>O(l) 3/4 2KAl(OH)<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 3H2**

Potassium aluminate solution on treatment with dilute Sulphuric acid first gives precipitate Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, which dissolves on addition of small excess of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and heating.

**2KOH(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq)3/4 -> 2Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>(s) + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)**

**2Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>(s) + 3H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq)3/4 -> Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(aq) + 6H<sub>2</sub>O(l)**

The resulting solution is concentrated to near saturation and cooled. On cooling crystals of potash alum crystallize out.

**K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(aq) + 24H<sub>2</sub>O(l)3/4 -> K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.24H<sub>2</sub>O(s)**

# PROCEDURE

1) Clean a small piece of scrap aluminium with steel wool and cut it into very small pieces. Aluminium foil may be taken insert of scrap aluminium.
2) Put the the small piece of scrap aluminium or aluminium foil (about 1.00g) into a conical flask and add about 50ml of 4M KOH solution to dissolve the aluminium.
3) The flask may be heated gently in order to facilitate dissovled. Since during this step hydrogen gas is evolved, this step must be done in a well ventilated area.
4) Continue heating until all of the aluminium reacts.
5) Filter the solution to remove any insoluble impurities and reduce the volume to about 25ml by heating.
6) Allow the filtrate to cool. Now add slowly 6M H2SO4 until insoluble Al(OH)3 just forms in the solution.
7) Gently heat the mixture until the Al(OH)3 precipitate dissolves.
8) Cool the resulting solution in an ice-bath for about 30 minutes whereby alum crystals should separate out. For better results the solution may be left overnight for crystallization to continue.
9) In case crytals do not form the solution may be further concentrated and cooled again.
10) Filter the crytals from the solution using vacuum pump; wash the crystals with 50/50 ethanol-water mixture.
11) Continue applying the vacuum until the crystals appear dry.
12) Determine the mass of alum crystals.
